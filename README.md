# discord-market-bot
A bot that manages a custom store on discord

# Basic usage

Allows users to interact with products on discord. This interaction creates a basket for each user adding those wanted products. Then, the users can conclude their purchases, and a few payment methods will be shown for them.

There is also a section where users can create a support ticket. A private channel will be open including the user and the administrators of that store.
